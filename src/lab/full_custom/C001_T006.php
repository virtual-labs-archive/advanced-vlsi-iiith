<h3>Full Custom Design</h3>
<div>
Full-custom design is a methodology for designing integrated circuits by specifying the layout of each individual transistor and the interconnections between them. Alternatives to full-custom design include various forms of semi-custom design, such as the repetition of small transistor sub-circuits; one such methodology is the use of standard cell libraries (standard cell libraries are themselves designed using full-custom design techniques).
<br/>
Full-custom design potentially maximizes the performance of the chip, and minimizes its area, but is extremely labor-intensive to implement. Full-custom design is limited to ICs hat are to be fabricated in extremely high volumes, notably certain microprocessors and a small number of ASICs.
