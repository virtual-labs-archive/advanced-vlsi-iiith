Once you have half adders and full adders, you can now construct ripple carry adders.

A ripple carry adder allows you to add two k-bit numbers. In this Experiment we have to design ripple carry adder using full adders.We have to give user option to select which ripple carry adder he wants to see ,it can be 4 bit ,8 bit or 12 bit and according to that we have to show user get level diagram and schematic diagram of ripple carry adder.We also have to show simulation of ripple carry adder and allow him to change input bits in simulation so that he can learn more about how this type of adder works.
