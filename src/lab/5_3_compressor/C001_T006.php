<h3>Output Formula</h3>
<div>
The current work proposes a novel architecture of a 5-3 compressor that can produce output with only three gate delays. The architecture of the compressor has been obtained by suitably rewriting the Boolean equations of a 5-3 compressor as:

<br/>
Using equations (1), (2) and (3), we propose to design a multiplexer based architecture of a 5-3 compressor as shown in figure 2.
<br/>

From figure 2, it is evident that the output of the compressor requires 3 gate delays. It is therefore obvious that the proposed 5-3 compressor computes the compressed output with a much lesser delay than the conventional 5-3 compressor.

<h3>Power and Delay in circuit</h3>
<div>
 The power and delay of the proposed 5-3 compressor has been compared with that of the standard 5-3 compressor found in literature. Table I shows the comparative study of power and delay of the proposed 5-3 compressor and the standard 5-3 compressor found in literature.
A comparative study of the simulation results presented in table 1 indicates that the proposed 5-3 compressor is more efficient in terms of power, delay and power-delay product than its peer design.
