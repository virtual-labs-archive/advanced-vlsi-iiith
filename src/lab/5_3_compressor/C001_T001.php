<h3></h3>ARCHITECTURE OF A 5-3 COMPRESSOR
<div>
A <b>5-3 compressor </b>essentially comprises of a combinational logic circuit with five inputs and three outputs. It accepts a five bit input string as input, and produces its sum as output. Obviously, the maximum output of a 5-3 compressor can be 101, when all its input bits are at logic 1. The conventional architecture of a 5-3 compressor is based on the extended design of a conventional 4-2 compressor[2,3,4]. The architecture of a conventional 5-3 compressor is shown in figure 1.

As evident from the figure 1, the straightforward implementation of the 5-3 compressor entails for 5 gate delays. Moreover the least significant bit of the output requires 4 gate delays (delay imposed by four XOR gates). As a result, there can be a problem of synchronization of the output bits when the input bits change leading to static hazards. 

<br/>
<br/>
The straightforward implementation of the 5-3 compressor requires the use 5 XOR gates, 5 AND gates and 2 OR gates. However, the proposed 5-3 compressor requires the use of 5 XOR gates, 2 AND gates and 2 multiplexers. Since multiplexers can be implemented with only two transistors using pass transistor logic, therefore the proposed 5-3 compressor uses much hardware resources than the conventional 5-3 compressor.
