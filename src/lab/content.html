	    Welcome to the Physics lab!  In this lab, we will do
            virtual experiments to understand Newton's laws of 
            motion.  We will start with a simple pendulum, and 
            from then on, the experiments get more interesting.

		<li>The Java 3D API enables the creation of three-dimensional graphics applications and Internet-based 3D applets. It provides high-level constructs for creating and manipulation 3D geometry and building the structures used in rendering that geometry. With this software, you can efficiently define and render very large virtual worlds.</li>
