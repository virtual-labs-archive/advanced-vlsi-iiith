<h3>DEFINITION OF SYNCHRONOUS CIRCUIT</h3>
<div>
A <b>synchronous </b>circuit is a digital circuit in which the parts are synchronized by a clock signal.<br/>
In an ideal synchronous circuit, every change in the logical levels of its storage components is simultaneous. These transitions follow the level change of a special signal called the clock. <br/><br/>Ideally, the input to each storage element has reached its final value before the next clock occurs, so the behaviour of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly.

<br/>
<br/>

<h3>POWER DISSIPATION IN SYNCHRONOUS CIRCUIT</h3>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Synchronous circuits tend to draw a large amount of current right at the clock edge and shortly thereafter. <br/>The number of nodes switching (and hence, amount of current drawn) drops off rapidly after the clock edge, reaching zero just before the next clock edge,while in an asynchronous circuit, the switching times of the nodes are not correlated in this manner, so the current draw tends to be more uniform and less bursty.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
70% more power consumption compared to asynchronous design.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>

<li>
Human need for low power devices is growing incase of Biomedical devices (pacemaker etc..)
<br/>
<br/>
</li>

<li>
Need to find techniques which can result in power-saving in the synchronous circuit.

<h3>POWER DISSIPATION IN CIRCUIT HAVING GATED CLOCKING</h3><br/>
By the use of gated clocking the amout of average power consumed by the circuit is reduced considerably.
