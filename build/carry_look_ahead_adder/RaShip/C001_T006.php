<h3>Carry Looh Ahead Header</h3>
<div>
Carry Look Ahead Header is a type of adder used in digital logic.The carry look-ahead adder calculates one or more carry bits before the sum, which reduces the wait time to calculate the result of the larger value bits.
<br/>
A ripple-carry adder works in the same way as pencil-and-paper methods of addition. Starting at the rightmost (least significant) digit position, the two corresponding digits are added and a result obtained. It is also possible that there may be a carry out of this digit position (for example, in pencil-and-paper methods, "9+5=4, carry 1"). Accordingly all digit positions other than the rightmost need to take into account the possibility of having to add an extra 1, from a carry that has come in from the next position to the right.
