	    This Virtual Lab program is designed as a second level course in VLSI after completion of basic courses. A student should have knowledge Basic Electronic Circuits and Introduction to VLSI to get maximum profit from this lab program. The lab contrues the notion of developing integrated circuits and optimizing various parameters of its performance. It consist of 10 Labs each covering various aspects of VLSI design and applications. This program will help the students to understand the basic notion behind Full Custom and Semi Custom Design design. They will get an insight into the notion of realising logic circuits on Generic Architectures. The Lab includes Basic Datapath Circuits and strategies for their power performance optimization. This Lab includes a simulator where you can actually simulate the design for a particular input data and see various time and power characteristics and output response of the circuits. So all the best for the experiments.
